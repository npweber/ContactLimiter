Contact Limiter
_____________________

This is a simple utility used on my website, www.npwd.tech, to reset the hardcoded number of contact attempts recorded to 0 every 3 days, regardless of its current value. That way, I can check in the PHP script handling contact messages that the contact attempts already attempted aren't a massive number, therefore, no one can assualt the process with a infinite loop of messages, trying to create DDOS.

It's merely a systems util that earns a place in the portfolio. Feel free to check it out.
